# Job-Tracker

In this project I wanted to focus on creating a search bar that works with autocomplete suggestions. I used React and Bootstrap and it was my first time using Docker, and mockApi for fetching the Jobs Data. I split the code into many components, in order to maintain readability and functionality. It was my most difficult project so far, and I was aided by AI when things got too messy. 

If i was to visit this project again in the future, I would implement an apply button to the Jobs listings, that would lead the user to an application fill form.

Still a great learning experience and a step for further projects up ahead. The project is also deployed on Github pages too.
